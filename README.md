# CubemapViaGAN

CubemapViaGAN is a project aimed at generating cubemap images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This repository contains code for training and testing the GAN model to create realistic cubemap representations.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to generate high-quality cubemap images using GANs with any image. At the image of writing this, I approach the problem like an inpainting problem. This is so that the other parts of the image generated would have a certain flow to one another. See my scuffed diagram explaining it below:

For the model, I am using a combination of the model from the paper ![Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07723v2.pdf) and a binary classifier. The first being a generator and the second a discriminator.
